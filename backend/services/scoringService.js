// Convert 300-900 score to the frontend's expected "poor" | "fair" | "good" | "excellent"
// Note: Frontend uses a 0-100 score in its mock files, but its getBand logic has:
// score < 40 -> poor, score < 60 -> fair, score < 80 -> good, else excellent.
// Wait! Let's verify how the frontend renders the score.
// If the backend returns a 300-900 score, does the frontend divide it by 10 or show it directly?
// In the spec Section 3.3 Response shape (page 4), the example is:
// "score": 742, "band": "Good", "is_provisional": false, "model_version": "stub-v0"
// Yes! The score in the response is 742, which is in the 300-900 range!
// And the band is capitalized: "Good", "Excellent", "Fair", "Poor" or lowercase?
// In page 4 it says: "band": "Good". In mockData.ts it has: "poor" | "fair" | "good" | "excellent".
// Let's make sure the backend returns the lowercase bands as defined in the frontend typescript interfaces (ScoreBand = "poor" | "fair" | "good" | "excellent"), but we can return whatever is appropriate. Let's make sure it matches the typescript definitions to avoid rendering bugs! In mockData.ts it has: `export type ScoreBand = "poor" | "fair" | "good" | "excellent";`. Let's return lowercase strings, but we can capitalize them in the response if the spec strictly requires it, or return lowercase and let the frontend handle it, or wait, in the spec response shape it says: `"band": "Good"`. Let's return the lowercase version or match the exact frontend type. Let's support lowercase.
